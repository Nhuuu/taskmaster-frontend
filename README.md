This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Feature tasks:

```
A user should be able to visit the homepage of your React app and see the list of all tasks available in the database.
React should be well-factored into at least 2 components.
The homepage should have reasonable styling and layout. (Nothing too fancy, but it shouldnâ€™t make the user cringe.)
A user should be able to find that homepage on the Internet, deployed as a static site using S3.
```
